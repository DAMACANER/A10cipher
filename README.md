# A10_cipher
This is a Hill 2x2 cipher that totally gone wrong, it encrypts with Hill 2x2 cipher and decrypts with A10 cipher so you need to learn two ciphers in a row and understand my broken ass code to decrypt it.

A10 cipher decrypts everyt Hill 2x2 encrypted texts to AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA so good luck with that.

Update 1: Plays beheaded kamikaze sound after decryption.
I will not fix this code, it was supposed to be something different but hey thanks guys for making my day and making me happy. I love you all.

Update 2: Added argsparser support running main.py with -dir "Desired Folder" -ge and -e commands now encrypts the entire folder with .AAAAA extension. It only supports one type of extensions in folder so make sure your folder contains only ".txt", ".pdf" or any extension.
