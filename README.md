# A10_cipher
I MANAGED TO FUCKING FINALLY DECRYPT THIS PILE OF SHIT.
```ruby
options:
 Removed args, just fire main.py, or exe file.
```
well... this was a meme alphabet and cipher that mistakenly created because of some small fuckups in hill 2x2 matrix decryption, and every encrypted text was decrypted to AAAAAAA.

I implemented a morse alphabet, that is translated to A10 cipher. For example:
"A" is equal to: Aa0AAA
"E" is equal to: A10AA0A0AAAAAAAAA
Alphabet only supports english language for now.  There is a testfolder filled with Pitbull - Rain Over Me lyrics.

write py a10cipher.py -dir "testfolder location" -encrypt to encrypt all that lyrics.
write py a10cipher.py -dir "testfolder location" -decrypt to decrypt all that pile of stuff.

Will release .exe soon.

#TODOS

-> Add .docx and other extension supports to encrypt
-> Add .AAAA extension to every encrypted file instead of original extension.
