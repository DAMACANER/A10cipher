# A10_cipher
This is a Hill 2x2 cipher that totally gone wrong, it encrypts with Hill 2x2 cipher and decrypts with A10 cipher so you need to learn two ciphers in a row and understand my broken ass code to decrypt it.

A10 cipher decrypts everyt Hill 2x2 encrypted texts to AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA so good luck with that.

Update 1: Plays beheaded kamikaze sound after decryption.
