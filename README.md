# A10_cipher
I MANAGED TO **profanity** FINALLY DECRYPT THIS **profanity**
```ruby
options:
 Removed args, just fire main.py, or exe file.
```
well... this was a meme alphabet and cipher that mistakenly created because of some small **profanity** in hill 2x2 matrix decryption, and every encrypted text was decrypted to AAAAAAA.

every encrypted single message is thrown into message.txt with same folder to wherever you downloaded the .exe.

I implemented a morse alphabet, that is translated to A10 cipher. For example:
"A" is equal to: Aa0AAA
"E" is equal to: A10AA0A0AAAAAAAAA
Alphabet only supports english language for now.  There is a testfolder filled with Silent Planet lyrics.
