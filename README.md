# A10_cipher
This is a Hill 2x2 cipher that totally gone wrong, it encrypts with Hill 2x2 cipher and decrypts with A10 cipher so you need to learn two ciphers in a row and understand my broken ass code to decrypt it.

A10 cipher decrypts everyt Hill 2x2 encrypted texts to AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA so good luck with that.

Update 1: Plays beheaded kamikaze sound after decryption.
I will not fix this code, it was supposed to be something different but hey thanks guys for making my day and making me happy. I love you all.

Update 2: Added argsparser support running main.py with -dir "Desired Folder" -ge and -e commands now encrypts the entire folder with .AAAAA extension. It only supports one type of extensions in folder so make sure your folder contains only ".txt", ".pdf" or any extension. Test it out with py main.py -dir "whereveryoudownloadedthecode\A10_cipher\testfolder" -ge -e

and -dir "whereveryoudownloadedthecode\A10_cipher\testfolder" -d

I need to add multiple types of extension support to turn this into a scary malware.

Update 3: Implemented AAAA alphabet inspired by morse alphabet. Short ping (.) is equal to A and long ping (-) is equal to AAA. Check AAAA_code_DICT_lower for punctuation marks. py a10cipher.py -et converts your input message, py a10cipher.py -et -dir "randomfolder" encrypts entire .txt files in that folder according to AAAA morse alphabet and -et -f just encrypts a.txt file. Download test folder and give it a shot.
 
You still see the broken ass encryption and decryption process (A10, also known as AAAAAAAAAAA) when you run it, argparse is just optional.
